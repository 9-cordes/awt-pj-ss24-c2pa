Extension of C2PA to allow printable content

The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) is an industry initiative made up of technology companies and media organizations. Its main goal is to develop standards and best practices for the authenticity and provenance of digital content. Through the collaboration of organizations such as Adobe, BBC, Intel and Microsoft, the C2PA aims to help reduce the spread of misinformation and increase trust in digital content. The initiative focuses on developing technologies to tag and verify content to ensure that it has not been tampered with and that its provenance can be traced. What C2PA does not consider is an extension of digital content to printed content. Think of something like a C2PA printer. This would link the digital C2PA metadata of an image with a physically printed medium.
